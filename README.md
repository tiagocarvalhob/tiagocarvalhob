I'm a Front-End enthusiast building the foundation of my career as a developer. I have experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and I’m currently learning **Python** to expand my backend skills.

Besides programming, I master design tools like **Adobe Photoshop** and **Adobe Illustrator**, which I use to create professional visual content, logos, and UI assets with creativity and precision.

I'm organized, curious, and always eager to learn and collaborate. I believe that with consistency and passion, I can grow and build meaningful projects that make a difference.
